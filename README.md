 # Deep Learning Study Projects

 Hi! Welcome to my repository!
 
 I'm [João Salero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo%C3%A3o-s-37aa011a8/), Brazilian (living in Dublin/Ireland), 33-years-old.

 I'm starting a new phase of studies at MIT's [MicroMasters® Program in Statistics and Data Science](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/mitx-statistics-and-data-science), and I own the
 [Data Scientist Training](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/bundle/formacao-cientista-de-dados) and the [Artificial Intelligence Training](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/bundle/formacao-inteligencia-artificial).

 My idea is collaborating with the [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) and [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) community and, in addition, to demonstrating my level of knowledge and my evolution in Machine Learning. 

 Some of projects are focused on [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) and others are focused on [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning). All exercises are below, divided by theme and language ([R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/)).

 All the “mini-projects” I will review over time, updating them as I learn more techniques.

 Please, feel free to consult all the material. I hope I can help the community in some way!

Note: Some of the exercises comes from the classes and study proposals of the [Data Science Academy](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/), an e-course platform.
